								<h2>St. Augustine of Hippo</h2>
								Early Life: <br>He was born in 354 in Thagaste. His mother was a devout Christian, but his father was hardly religious, until his death (baptism right before death was common to clear your life of sins). Even though his mother had a big effect on him, he joined the Manichean sect, which teaches that life on earth is unbearable and evil. He became a hedonist, and had an affair with a woman that later had a child. He was the only child to be sent to learn, and eventually taught grammar and rhetoric at Thagaste, Carthage and later Rome. <br>Last half: <br>At the age of 30, he was given an important position as a rhetoric professor at the Imperial Court of Milan. During that time, he met and became friends with the bishop of Milan, Ambrose. His mother, who had followed him to Milan, convinced him to give up his lover, and marry an 11-year-old in his social class, even though he had a child. When he was questioning his lifestyle vs following God, he heard a voice saying “pick up and read, pick up and read.” He read Romans 13:13–14, and instantly ended his hedonistic lifestyle. He annulled his marriage, and made plans to become a priest. When he was 31, he officially converted to Christianity. He got baptized with his son in 388. His mother died shortly after. When he returned to Africa, his son died, so he gave away all his things to the poor, and in 391, became the bishop of Hippo. In the spring of 430, during a siege from the Vandals, Augustine became sick. He died in 430 in Ruines d'Hippone (Hippo Regius). <br>Accomplishments: <br>He wrote extensively on Christianity, including several important philosophical and theological works, still used today. He was canonized in 1298 by Pope Boniface VIII. His very life is an example of how even the most hedonistic, and evil person can change, and set their ways straight.</p>
