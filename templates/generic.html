								<h2>Menu</h2>
								<p>Appetizers<br>For the appetizers, I will serve a meat and cheese platter, and a caesar salad. These foods are easy to eat and talk at the same time.<br>Main Course<br>The main foods being served are fish, pork, pasta, and for the adults, wine with olives, as Augustine would have had wine with every dinner. This is a balanced meal that accommodates every guest.<br>Dessert<br>The dessert is napoleonka, which is a sort of cream cake. It has a flaky top and bottom, and is filled with cream, but the sides are left exposed. It is usually served in squares. An alternative name is kremsnita. The alternative dessert is a cherry pie.</p>
								<h2>Table</h2>
								<img src="table.jpg">
								<p>The shape that I have chosen is a rectangle. It is very simple, but quite efficient in dividing the people from any arguments that may arise. I will try to keep the conversation limited to respectful talking, or the disrespectful person will receive some break from the conversation. Because of this rule, where each person is sitting is less important, but I will divide the different views as follows. I am at the top end, Augustine is at the bottom end, Fauci is sitting to my left beside Peter Boylan, and Edmund D. Pellegrino is on my right, beside the pope.</p>
