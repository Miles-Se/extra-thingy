								<h2>What topics would be discussed during the meal?</h2>
								<p>The main topic would be “How far can modern medicine develop before it becomes “bad” for us, from a religious, scientific, and moral point of view.” This would most likely take up most of the time, because of how many variants there could be of this topic, especially if there is someone smart to lead the conversation (the doctors). Another topic would be about the problems that might come with improving medicine and related tech to the point that we won’t even need to be active anymore, both physically and mentally. This kind of medical transformation, can lead to death of society and greater function. Will humanity become lazy along with all the advancements? Other, more today-relavant issues, such as euthanasia will be mentioned. We all have value as God’s children, so should premature death be allowed?</p>
								<h2>If one guest had to be excluded, who would it be?</h2>
								<p>The guest I would exclude would have to be St. Augustine, because he has very outdated medical views. Many of the conversation topics would have to be explained to him. In fact, with or without him, the dinner would still run smoothly, because the pope and Pellegrino, and Peter Boylan and Fauci would each be a pair. Both the secular and religious groups would have each other’s backs in the argument. There are two problems with this. One is the fact that if one person agreed with the other group, it would leave one person isolated. The second is that many arguments could take place, because there are 2 groups against each other with no one in the middle. Still, I believe that St. Augustine is the better choice out of everyone, even though he could bring personal experience as a doctor from 1600 years ago.</p>
								<h2>Do you think that any of your guests would feel uncomfortable or left out?</h2>
								<p>Considering the fact that I added an old religious doctor and a new, non-religious doctor, the latter might feel left out. That is why I added Edmund to make the other doctor feel more comfortable, as he has someone to agree with his views. The pope might be happy to see a saint, and they would agree on most things, so they would be happy. Both pairs might have different views on certain topics with each other, so Fauci will try to keep the discussion away from those, tying the whole group together. I tried my best to balance out the opposing views, and I will try to keep the conversation limited to respectful and peaceful talking. A possible consequence is the disrespectful person will receive some break from the conversation.</p>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>Overall, I am not going to play a large active role in the conversation, but I will still contribute, as I do have things to say. The reason that I didn’t include myself in the explanation above, is I will try to be as neutral as I can be. I believe this would make the other people feel at ease, as there is no interruption from someone that is not an expert. I would mainly be moderating the conversation. This dinner would be a great opportunity to learn from the greatest minds of history about the ethics of medicine. If the conversation was published, I believe that it would clear up many problems that are currently unsolved. The last thing to mention, is that the idea of discussing something 100s of years into the future should not be a problem, considering that we have a guest from 1600 years ago.</p>
